# Customization

If you're new to using Web Components, you'll quickly notice that the traditional way of styling elements with CSS doesn't work with Astro components.

For example, this won't work:
```html
<rux-button style="background:red;">button</rux-button>
```

This is a feature of the Shadow DOM--outside styles cannot be applied to content inside the Shadow DOM. Luckily, the Web Component spec provides two solutions
to this problem: CSS Custom Properties and CSS Shadow Parts.


## Using CSS Custom Properties

Each component API has a set of CSS Custom Properties defined. These are variables that you can set externally that will reflect inside the Shadow DOM.
CSS Custom Properties are a lot like SASS variables, with one significant difference--they can be swapped at run time and do not require any build process.
These CSS Custom Properties will usually be mapped to some CSS property (color, font-size, border-radius, etc).

If you wanted to change the Button background, you could use the `--button-background-color` custom property like so:
```css
rux-button {
  --button-background-color: red;
}
```

## Using CSS Shadow Parts

Because defining CSS Custom Properties for every possible CSS property is incredibly verbose and cumbersome, the recommended way for styling components is
to make use of [CSS Shadow Parts](https://css-tricks.com/styling-in-the-shadow-dom-with-css-shadow-parts/). CSS Shadow Parts give you full control over
the styling of a component's underlying Shadow DOM parts.

If a component has any available Shadow Parts, they will be documented under their API section.

If you wanted to create a horizontal label, you could do the following:
```css
rux-input::part(form-field) {
  flex-direction: row;
  align-items: center;
}
rux-input::part(label) {
  margin-right: 1rem;
}
```
