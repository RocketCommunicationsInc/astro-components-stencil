# Welcome to the Astro Storybook

This is the Astro UXDS Storybook, a sandbox for demonstrating and developing components and patterns built for
the Astro Space UX Design System ("Astro UXDS"). This demonstration is built using the open source tool
[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) using JavaScript and Node.js. All Astro components are built
using <a href="https://stenciljs.com/docs/introduction" target="_blank">Stencil</a> to deliver standards-compliant web components.
Astro web components are platform-agnostic and can be used in any javascript framework of your choice or directly in the browser
using static HTML. For more about the Astro UXDS purpose and approach to space app experiences, check out <a href="https://www.astrouxds.com/" target="_blank">AstroUXDS.com</a>.

In the Sidebar to the left, you can browse the components and patterns within Astro. Each example will
be demonstrated in what is called a "story" within the Canvas (the area of the window you're
reading now). Across the top of the Canvas area, you will see zoom controls, a color blindness
simulator, and a light/dark theme toggle.

{' '}
<p>
    To the right of the Canvas, there is a tabbed Panel which displays Knobs,
    Readme files for each component, as well as an Accessibilty audit, and any
    Actions outputs associated with that demonstration.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The <b>Knobs</b> options allow you to change content in the
        demonstration area by altering the data given to the component via its
        properties.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <b>Readme</b> tab shows developer documentation for the patterns or
        components.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <b>Accessibilty</b> tab displays a11y violations of WCAG 2.0 Levels
        A and AA, WCAG 2.1 Level AA, Section 508, and other best practices
        through the
        <a href="https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core" target="_blank">
            aXe accessibilty engine
        </a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <b>Actions</b> tab provides console output where user actions like
        clicking or selecting should produce event target information.
    </li>
    <li>Note: Not every component uses all three tabs.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Display options and keyboard shortcuts are available via the ellipsis menu
    icon next to the Astro UXDS logo at the top of the sidebar.
