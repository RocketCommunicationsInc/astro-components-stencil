# Grouped Buttons

Common button groupings follow these conventions:

-   Cancel buttons are always presented to the left of actions such as “Submit.”

-   Always group together “Ok/Cancel” buttons. Do not justify them apart, but keep a reasonable margin between the buttons.

-   Buttons within the same group should maintain their inherent size. Do not stretch one button to match another’s width.
